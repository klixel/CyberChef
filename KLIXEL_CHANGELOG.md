# Changelog

## Versioning

This fork of CyberChef is linked to the original repository, so it uses semver for versioning of changes made in the original repository and date-based versioning in the format `DD.MM.YYYY` for changes made in this fork.

Just as in the original repository, all major and minor changes will be documented here, whereas the patch changes will be documented in [commit messages](https://github.com/klixel/CyberChef/commits/master).
